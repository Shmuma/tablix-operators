branch. Source code distribution can be downloaded from the following
URL:

http://www.tablix.org/releases/stable/tablix2-0.3.5.tar.gz

This release mostly fixes bugs in the kernel. Following issues were fixed:

	Segmentation fault in the XML parser when no constant resource
	types were defined.

	Erroneous messages about failed assertions when resource type with
	id 0 was a variable resource type.

        Build error on GCC 4.1.

Four fitness modules (firstlastequal, firstorlast, maxconsecutive and
maxperday) were also added to the distribution (development sponsored by
The Media Shoppe Berhad).

This release splits the distribution into three Debian packages:
tablix2, tablix2-doc and tablix2-dev.

See ChangeLog file included in the distribution for more details.

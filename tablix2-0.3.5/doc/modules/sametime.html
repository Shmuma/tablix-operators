		<h1>sametime.so module reference</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adds a weight whenever a teacher or a class is required to be in two 
rooms at the same time.</p>
<p>Please note that this module will not consider it as an error if a teacher or
a class has two events scheduled at the same time in the same room. This
means that in 99% of cases you need to use this module together with
<a href="timeplace.html">timeplace.so</a> to get the expected results.</p>
		<h2>Required resource types</h2>
		<p>Configuration file must define the following resource types 
		in order to use this module:</p>

		<ul>
<li>class</li>
<li>room</li>
<li>teacher</li>
<li>time</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Defined resource restrictions</h2>
<h3>conflicts-with (resource types class, teacher)</h3><pre>&lt;restriction type="conflicts-with"&gt;name&lt;/restriction&gt;</pre>
<p>This restriction specifies that current class or teacher should never have 
lessons at the same time as the class or teacher specified in the 
restriction.</p>
<p>There are two common uses for this restriction: When multiple classes share
an event and when multiple teachers share an event. Consider the following 
example:</p>
<p>Let's say we have two groups of students. Each group has its own timetable
except a couple of lessons which they share.</p>
<p>We define each group of students plus an extra group for the shared lessons.</p>
<pre>&lt;resourcetype type="class"&gt;
	&lt;resource name="Group 1"&gt;
		&lt;restriction type="conflicts-with"&gt;Group 1+2&lt;/restriction&gt;
	&lt;/resource&gt;
	&lt;resource name="Group 2"&gt;
		&lt;restriction type="conflicts-with"&gt;Group 1+2&lt;/restriction&gt;
	&lt;/resource&gt;
	&lt;resource name="Group 1+2"/&gt;
&lt;/resourcetype&gt;</pre>
<p>This way group 1+2 will never have lessons at the same time as
groups 1 and 2 and students from either group will be able to attend
lectures in group 1+2.</p>
<p>Multiple teachers per event can be defined in a similar way.</p>
		<h2>Defined tuple restrictions</h2>
		<h2>Supported module options</h2>
<h3>recursive-conflicts</h3>
<p>If this module option is present (any option value is ignored), then all
"conflicts-with" restrictions become recursive.</p>
<p>For example: if class A conflicts with class B and class A conflicts with 
class C, then class B will also automatically conflict with class C.</p>
<p>Without this option class C will not conflict with class B unless you 
specify this with another "conflicts-with" restriction.</p>

		<h2>Module groups</h2>
		<p>This module belongs to the following groups:</p>
		<ul>
<li>School scheduling</li>
<li>Multiweek scheduling</li>
		</ul>

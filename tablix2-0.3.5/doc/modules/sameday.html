		<h1>sameday.so module reference</h1>

		<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Adds a weight if a class or a teacher (as specified by the "resourcetype"
module option) has the same subject more than N 
times in a day.</p>
<p>Default for N is 1. Default value can be changed with the module option 
"default". Default value for N can also be overridden for individual 
teachers, classes and events with various restrictions.</p>
		<h2>Required resource types</h2>
		<p>Configuration file must define the following resource types 
		in order to use this module:</p>

		<ul>
<li>time</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Defined resource restrictions</h2>
<h3>ignore-sameday (all resource types)</h3><pre>&lt;resourcetype type="class"&gt;
	&lt;resource name="example-class"&gt;
		&lt;restriction type="ignore-sameday"/&gt;
	&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/resourcetype&gt;</pre>
<p>Set this restriction to a class or a teacher that you don't want to be 
checked for multiple occurrences of the same subject in a day.</p>
<p>This module then ignores classes that have this restriction, however this
setting can be overridden for individual events if "set-sameday" restriction 
is used on an event for this class or teacher.</p>
<h3>set-sameday (all resource types)</h3><pre>&lt;resourcetype type="class"&gt;
	&lt;resource name="example-class"&gt;
		&lt;restriction type="set-sameday"&gt;2&lt;/restriction&gt;
	&lt;/resource&gt;
&lt;/resourcetype&gt;</pre>
<p>With this restriction you can set a maximum number of equal events a class
or a teacher can have in a day. This setting can be overridden for 
individual events if "set-sameday" event restriction is used on an event 
for this class or teacher.</p>
		<h2>Defined tuple restrictions</h2>
<h3>consecutive</h3>
<p>This is an alias for "ignore-sameday" restriction. It is defined for 
convenience when this module is used together with <a href="consecutive.html">consecutive.so</a> module.</p>
<h3>ignore-sameday</h3>
<p>Set this restriction to all events that you do not want to be checked for
multiple occurences per day.</p>
<p>This retriction overrides the default setting and settings made by 
any resource restrictions.</p>
<h3>periods-per-block</h3>
<p>This is an alias for "set-sameday-blocksize" restriction. It is defined for 
convenience when this module is used together with <a href="consecutive.html">consecutive.so</a> module.</p>
<h3>set-sameday</h3>
<pre>&lt;event name="example" repeats="5"&gt;
		...
		&lt;restriction type="set-sameday"&gt;2&lt;/restriction&gt;
&lt;/resourcetype&gt;</pre>
<p>With this restriction you can set a maximum number of events of type type
that a class or a teacher can have in a day.</p>
<p>This retriction overrides the default setting and settings made by 
any resource restrictions.</p>
<h3>set-sameday-blocksize</h3>
<p>With this restriction you can tell this module that the current event 
will be scheduled in blocks of this number of equal consecutive events.</p>
<p>Module will then consider a block of events as a single event when checking 
for multiple occurences per day.</p>
<p>Default block size is 1.</p>
		<h2>Supported module options</h2>
<h3>default</h3>
<p>Use this option to set the default number of equal events classes or 
teachers can have in day.</p>
<h3>resourcetype</h3>
<p>Use this option to specify one or more constant resource types. Specified
resource types will have their timetables checked by this module.</p>
<p>Use option</p>
<pre>&lt;option name="resourcetype"&gt;class&lt;/option&gt;</pre>
<p>to get the same behaviour as this module had before Tablix version 0.3.1.</p>

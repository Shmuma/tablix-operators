/**
@group Unknown

These modules don't include any information on which group they belong
to. The most probable reason is that they haven't been ported to the
0.2.x kernel yet or they lack proper comment blocks.

/**
@group School scheduling

This group of modules can be used to construct weekly or bi-weekly
schedules, such as those used in elementary and high schools and also some
universities.

Most of them require at least the following resource types to be
defined in the problem description file: 'class', 'teacher', 'room' and 'time'.
*/

/**
@group Multiweek scheduling

This group of modules can be used to construct timetables
for longer periods of time in cases where weekly or bi-weekly recurring
schedules are not suitable. Such an example would be an university where
different classes start and finish at different times in the semester.

This group is similar to the School scheduling group and shares many of
the same modules. It also shares the requirement for the four basic
resource types: 'class', 'teacher', 'room' and 'time'.
*/

/**
@group General

This group contains modules that can be used in many contexts. The only
requirement is that the problem description contains a matrix resource
type called 'time'.
